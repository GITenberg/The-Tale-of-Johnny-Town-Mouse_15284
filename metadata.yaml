description: "The Tale of Johnny Town-Mouse is a children's book written and illustrated\
  \ by Beatrix Potter and first published by Frederick Warne & Co. in December 1918.\
  \ The tale is based on the Aesop fable, \"The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse\"\
  , with details taken from Horace's Satires 2.6.79-117. It tells of a country mouse\
  \ and a city mouse who visit each other in their respective homes. After sampling\
  \ the other's way of life, both express a decided preference for their own. The\
  \ book was critically well received. The Johnny Town-mouse character appeared in\
  \ a 1971 ballet film, and the tale has been adapted to a BBC television animated\
  \ series.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
